# kickstarter data visualisation
**A few visualisation in vega-lite on the kickstarter dataset.**

A few questions addressed, along with a screenshot of visualizations:
* *How did the number of backers influence the result of the project? Does a higher number of backers really mean a larger overall goal? What is the relation between goals and success wrt number of backers?*

* *How many days does a successful campaign last? How many days does a campaign last before being cancelled? What is the average deadline for failed campaigns? What is the relationship with the goal needed for funding?*

* *How many projects usually succeed? Which category of projects are likely to succeed?*
