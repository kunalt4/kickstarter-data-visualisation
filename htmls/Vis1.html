            The bar chart shows the median goal with an increase in number of
            backers. Each bar shows the median goal for that particular number
            of backers. The colour of the bar represents the count of records
            for each group of backers. The orange line shows the average success
            ratio of projects. Hovering over the bar shows the group of backers,
            the median goal and the number of records. Hovering over a point on
            the line shows the success ratio.

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">
            From the chart we can see, that as the number of backers increases,
            the success percentage of projects also increases. This means with a
            larger number of backers, projects are more likely to be funded -
            which is pretty obvious.
            <p />
            Except, with a larger number of backers, the median goal amount also
            increases. That points to more overall success with a large number
            of backers and a higher goal, than a low goal and low number of
            backers. This might be the effect of a large amount being funded by
            a few chosen backers - which is a bigger probability with a large
            number of backers as opposed to fewer. So projects with a large
            number of backers tend to succeed even taking in the higher goal, as
            opposed to projects with a low number of backers with a
            corresponding low goal.
            <p />
            As expected, a large number of projects have between 0 and 20
            backers, and the number gets lower as the number of backers
            increases. An interesting observation seen here is that for backers
            in the range 0-20, the median goal is higher, while for backers in
            the range 20-40 and 40-60, the median goal is quite low - which also
            leads to a better success rate in these ranges. With a huge number
            of projects having very few backers, the success rate is
            understandably low - as most projects fail if they do not get enough
            backers. Once a threshold of backers has crossed, the success rate
            increases even with higher goals.

          </td>
          <td style="vertical-align: top;">
            I have used a layer to convey both parts of the question, as opposed
            to two different charts. This leads to the interesting insight
            above.
            <p />
            An alternative approach to this would've been to plot the success
            and failure numbers instead of success ratio, but I felt a ratio is
            better suited since total count varies with the backer, as shown
            using the bar gradient. Another alternative thought of was using a
            scatter plot to chart the percent success and failures with backers,
            but this was discarded as a binned line plot to group number of
            backers seemed more appropriate for an overall trend.

            The dataset for the project was huge, and was filtered to show only
            a few columns for this visualisation. The number of backers was
            limited to 200 for the purpose of this visualisation, and a column
            created for successes in the data, with the value of successful
            projects kept to 1, as opposed to 0 for other statuses. This was
            done for easier calculation of average success in the visualisation.
